note: You can just simply use navigation bar to go to each page. For static data, it is stored in the localstorage and can be called once you click the related button on the test page. Since it will be hard to be messed up, there is no purge function implemented for them. For time information, it will be stored separately for each page. For dynamic data, especially click and mouse movement, I use several examples to show my logic. I did not make it working for all parts of each page since it may be very time consuming. You can test my results using the button in form.html as well as the first three buttons in test page. Besides, you can test my mouse movement function using the flower image file in images.html as well as the image in the test page. For keystrokes, only input area in form.html is implemented. Each of the handler supports a purge function as well as requested. Please feel free to ask me if there is anything confused.
